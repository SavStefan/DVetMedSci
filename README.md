Supplementary material for the DVetMedSci thesis submitted by Stefan Saverimuttu

global.R, server.R, and ui.R files contain the R/Shiny code for the D.E.E text-mining application for the Wildbase Pathology Register. 

The fully functional application is accessible in-browser via:  https://stefansav.shinyapps.io/necropsy-text-mining-2/ 

Github Data.csv contains a small random selection of accessions from the Wildbase Pathology Register that can be used to explore functions in the application. This data is not representative of any subset of the Wildbase Pathology Register and some data has been modified for confidentiality purposes.  

Supp_annotating app.R and Supp_analysis app.R files contain the R/Shiny code used in the misclassification analysis of the pilot application testing study (Chapter 4) of this study. 

Supp_9 testers.csv is the complete data of the analysis performed in the pilot application testing study (Chapter 5) of this study.
